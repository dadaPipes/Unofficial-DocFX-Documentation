# Introduction

## Overview

I want to contribute to DocFX because I believe it has a lot of potential.

Currently not supported:

- Versioning
- Diagrams from source code
- Include API links in the diagrams

I have a some basic ideas of how I could implement the above features, but I will dive in to that on a later stage.  
For now I will figure out how the DocFX works internally, so I can contribute to the official project.

## Attack plan for DocFX

**What are the big moving parts ?**  

- How does the projects depend on each other ?
- What are the system boundaries and responsibilities ?

**How is each project build ?**

- Structure, interfaces, dependencies ?
- Project boundary ?

**How is the flow ?**

- How do a user interact with the system ?
- Where is there entry point ?
- What are the class/interface boundaries ?
- Flow between projects ?
